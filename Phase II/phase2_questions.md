Given the following discretized equation for computing the density:

$$
temp
$$

Where $temp$, and approximating density calculations over the grid points for $0 \leq x \leq 1$, $0 \leq t \leq T$ with the initial condition set to 0 and the boundary condition set to $temp$, i.e. $temp$, $temp$, $temp$, $temp$, $temp$, $temp$, and the exact solution
