- The graph above shows the errors for gamma = 0 and gamma = 1.75, as $\Delta x$ increases so does the error values. The error line for gamma = 1.75 is slightly more linear compared to that of gamma = 0
![Exact vs Approx Solution at t=0.4](images/exact_vs_approx_t04.png)
- The curves of exact vs approx. are plotted for gamma = 0, and gamma = 1.75 at x = 0.5. Towards the edges the turns are not as sharp as the scheme smooths the data out, more gamma = 1.75 the curves are smoother with more data points compared to gamma = 0
![Exact vs Approx Solution at x=0.5](images/exact_vs_approx_x05.png)
- The curves of exact vs approx. are plotted for gamma = 0, and gamma = 1.75 at t = 0.4. We see a similar trend as towards the edges the turns are not as sharp as the scheme smooths the data out, more gamma = 1.75 the curves are smoother with more data points compared to gamma = 0
![Period IC/BC: Exact vs Approx at gamma=0](images/period_icbc_exact_vs_approx_gamma0.png)
The periodic solutions show different gamma values at diffrerent times, we see the data converge and diverge at different points. For gamma = 1.75 the converging is tighter than for gamma = 0
